## Intro
OpenAI has began to roll out new voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT offering a new, more intuitive type of interface by allowing users to have a voice conversation or show ChatGPT what they are talking about.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, indicated this on X: {{< tweet user="sama" id="1706292549198237997" >}}

OpenAI is really giving Big Tech companies like **Google** and **Apple** a run for their money.

## Understanding Voice and Vision Modes

Picture this: you're talking to your virtual assistant about your favorite vacation destination, and not only does it understand your words but also the breathtaking images you describe.

This isn't science fiction. Super awesome, right?

### Speak with ChatGPT
You can now spark a conversation, on any matter, with your AI Assistant and have it talk back to you.

This new voice capability is powered by a text-to-speech model capable of generating human-like audio from the prompts given.

### Chat about images

You can now upload an image or more to ChatGPT and let it analyse the whole of it or simply an highligted area.

This image understanding is powered by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 multimodals which can analyse a wide range of images, such as photographs and screenshots, and documents that contain both text and images

## The Competition with Google and Apple

You've probably heard of [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/) and [Siri](https://www.apple.com/siri/), right? These virtual pals have been our go-to helpers for tasks ranging from setting alarms to answering trivia questions. But there's a catch â€” they've struggled when it comes to handling images effectively. 

OpenAI's multimodal AI could be the trump card in this competition. With the ability to understand and communicate using both words and images, it's like giving your virtual assistant the gift of sight.

### Is there Potential Collaboration?

Google and Apple, with their eyes on the same prize, might need to adapt quickly to this AI evolution.

One could argue that the possibility of them teaming up with OpenAI is not far-fetched. Such collaborations could mean even smarter virtual assistants and seamless integration into your favorite tech ecosystem.

## What are the benefits of these new features?

Whether it's asking a question, seeking information, or giving commands, the ability to incorporate both voice and visual input makes user experience more engaging and efficient.

In educational settings, it can provide interactive learning experiences. For instance, it can explain complex scientific concepts while displaying relevant visuals, making learning more engaging.

These modes make technology more accessible to individuals with disabilities. People with visual impairments can use voice commands while those with hearing impairments can rely on visual input, allowing AI to cater for a wider range of users.

The integration of voice and vision capabilities in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality applications can provide users with more immersive experiences. For instance, in an AR game, users can describe the environment around them letting the AI respond accordingly.

For platforms and applications such as X, Instagram, and TikTok dealing with user-generated content, AI with Vision mode can help in content moderation by analyzing images and videos for inappropriate or harmful content, thus creating safer online environments.

## Outro
This is just the tip of the iceberg. The future of AI interactions is becoming increasingly exciting, we're only scratching the surface. Buckle up, the next era of virtual assistants promises to be quite the spectacle!
