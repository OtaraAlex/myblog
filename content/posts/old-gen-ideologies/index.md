No disrespect to the older generations' persons holding positions in power but I think, for a society to progress, they should retire so the young can implement things that actually work.

One aspect I can't quite grasp is their reluctance to embrace change and adapt to evolving societal needs. "Do not touch it if it works" is the code they actually live by. This has led to a disconnect in addressing our concerns. However, it's essential to recognize that not all fall into this category, and effective leadership transcends age.

There's always hope when a younger person joins the *High Table* but we forget everything we once wanted to change maybe because it doesn't affect us anymore.

Let's change cultural norms, and let the younger generation steer us off, with the older offering guidance when necessary.
