Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Software Engineer and an Economics & Statistics student.

## What I do

I'm based in Kenya and I have been shipping code for just over a year. I mainly work with Front-end web projects but ocassionally dabble in some Fullstack development.

Check out my [portfolio](https://www.alexotara.tech/)

## Outside of Tech

Outside of tech, I'm deeply immersed in the world of `overlanding`, eagerly tracking the adventures of intrepid travelers. Simultaneously, my passion for `photography` fuels my relentless quest for innovative ways to capture and convey the world's splendor through my camera lens.

These twin passions afford me a rich tapestry of experiences and perspectives, enabling me to traverse the globe both digitally and artistically.

## This Site 

Over the years, my blog has undergone a couple of changes. Initially, I made it with good ol' HTML, tried WordPress and Medium. Later, I started to use a couple of templates and making customizations to align with my personal style.

Currently, this site is built using [Hugo][hugo] static site generator and [Blowfish][blowfish].
