Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Software Engineer and an Economics & Statistics student.

## What I do

I'm based in Kenya, and I've been actively shipping code for a little more than a year. My primary focus is on front-end web projects, although from time to time, I also dabble in full-stack development.

## Outside of Tech

Besides tech, I'm deeply immersed in the realm of `overlanding`, avidly tracking travellers' adventures. Simultaneously, my passion for `photography` fuels my relentless quest to capture and convey the world's splendor through my camera lens.

These twin passions afford me a rich tapestry of experiences and perspectives, enabling me to traverse the globe both digitally and artistically.

## This Site 

Throughout the year, my blog has undergone a couple of changes. Initially, I made it with good ol' HTML, tried WordPress and Medium. Later, I started to use a couple of templates and making customizations to align with my personal style.

Currently, this site is built using [Hugo][hugo] static site generator and [Blowfish][blowfish].
