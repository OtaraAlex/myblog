In this blog post we will cover;\nWhat a static site generator is Intro to Hugo Using a free Hugo template to generate your blog Alright, letâ€™s get right into it!\nWhat is a static site generator? A static site generator or SSG is defined as being\n\u0026ldquo;A script which takes in data, content and templates, processes them, and outputs a folder full of all the resultant pages and assets.\u0026rdquo;\nNow to break down this definition we can travel back in time before the era of SSG. In a traditional web server, when a user visits a page the server builds the content of that specific page using the underlying stack like PHP by fetching data from either the database or an API. The server then returns this result to the users browser and voila you have a website. These kinds of websites are referred to as dynamic websites. In contrast we have static websites that have stable content i.e the content viewed by all the users is the same (static).\nStatic site generators therefore take the data provided to them in this case a blog like this one written in either markdown, yaml or any specific format and parse it into a static website.\nWhy use a site generator? There are a couple of reasons but just to mention a few\nStatic sites are fast. Since they donâ€™t require a database and they pre-build all the pages, users can access content blazingly fast. Ease of deployment. Since these sites are static they essentially donâ€™t need a complicated sever setup They are very cost effective. The server resources used are minimal since there is no database and the content is already prebuilt. Version Control. Since the entire site is a combination of files and folders, you can leverage GIT to keep track of changes and collaborate with others. Intro to Hugo There are several static site generators out there that you can choose from like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby and Next.js.\nIn this blog post we will mainly focus on Hugo, which is written in the Golang language.\nFor the purposes of this demo we will be using a linux machine. I will attach alternative guidelines for different platforms.\nTo get started, install Hugo as below\nsudo apt install hugo For installation on Windows or MacOS follow the guide here.\nAfter successfully installing Hugo you will have access to the hugo command in your terminal with which you can create your first site\nhugo new site mywebsite This command will create a directory, mywebsite, in the root directory.\nUsing a free Hugo template to generate your blog Using Hugo comes with the advantage of having access to a variety of free beautiful themes. You can use these themes to make your website. This lets you focus on sharing your content with the world and not dwell to much on designing.\nWe are going to use a theme called blowfish the very theme used on this site. It uses markdown files for content and yaml for configuration files. It is also very customizable to your preference.\nTo install this theme we will set it up a submodule in our hugo generated website.\ncd mywebsite git init git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish We are doing this mainly so that we can pull changes from the main blowfish repository in case they ever make important changes to the theme using.\ngit submodule update --remote --merge Configuring the Theme Blowfish does not constrain you on how to organize your content. An example of how to structure your content is as follows\n. â”œâ”€â”€ assets â”‚ â””â”€â”€ img â”‚ â””â”€â”€ author.jpg â”œâ”€â”€ config â”‚ â””â”€â”€ _default â”œâ”€â”€ content â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ _index.md â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ about.md â”‚ â””â”€â”€ posts â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ _index.md â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ first-post.md â”‚ â””â”€â”€ another-post â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ aardvark.jpg â”‚ â””â”€â”€ index.md â””â”€â”€ themes â””â”€â”€ blowfish There are numerous ways you can edit the theme to suit your needs read this documentation to find out how.\nRun this command locally to view your site.\nhugo server Conclusion In this article we covered what static site generators are, went over examples and specifically targeted Hugo.\nWe got to see how to use a free Hugo theme to implement a blog website and finally we served the website locally. It should be noted that from here you can easily deploy your website with Netlify for free in just a few simple steps.\nVoila! You have now set up a website with little to no coding.\nReach me on email or any of my social media handles if you have any questions or just want a chat :)\n","date":"9 September 2023","permalink":"/static_sites/","section":"Posts","summary":"In this post we go over the ease of creating a site using SSGs","title":"Create Your Blog with Hugo's Static Site Generator"},{"content":"","date":"9 September 2023","permalink":"/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hugo"},{"content":"","date":"9 September 2023","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 September 2023","permalink":"/tags/static-site-generators/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Static Site Generators"},{"content":"","date":"9 September 2023","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 September 2023","permalink":"/categories/technical/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Technical"},{"content":"Here is a collection of other places you can find me and websites/articles I find interesting.
