We often find ourselves stuck in a cycle of overthinking and planning, without ever taking the crucial first step towards our objectives. In this blog, we will explore the concept of \u0026ldquo;Just Starting\u0026rdquo; and why it\u0026rsquo;s a mantra that can change your life.\nThe Power of Starting Overcoming Inertia Imagine a stationary object, like a car at rest. It requires a significant amount of force to get it moving initially, but once it\u0026rsquo;s in motion, it becomes easier to keep going. The same principle applies to our lives. When we\u0026rsquo;re stuck in a rut or faced with a daunting task, taking that first step is like applying the initial force needed to overcome inertia. It breaks the cycle of inaction and propels us forward.\nLearning by Doing No amount of planning or preparation can replace the knowledge and experience gained from actually doing something. When you \u0026ldquo;Just Start,\u0026rdquo; you put yourself in a position to learn, adapt, and improve along the way. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s starting a new business, learning a new skill, or embarking on a fitness journey, you\u0026rsquo;ll never know what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t until you take that first step.\nBuilding Momentum Starting something new creates momentum. Each small step you take builds upon the last, gradually increasing your momentum and propelling you toward your goal. Think of it like a snowball rolling down a hill – it starts small, but as it picks up snow along the way, it becomes larger and more powerful. By \u0026ldquo;Just Starting,\u0026rdquo; you set this process in motion.\nOvercoming Obstacles Fear and Self-Doubt Fear of failure and self-doubt are two of the most common obstacles that prevent us from taking that first step. However, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to remember that these feelings are natural. Instead of letting them paralyze you, acknowledge them and use them as motivation to prove yourself wrong. Remember, everyone starts somewhere, and even the most successful individuals faced these emotions at the beginning of their journeys.\nPerfectionism Perfectionism can be a major roadblock. It often leads to analysis paralysis, where we endlessly plan and revise without ever executing. Embrace the idea that perfection is unattainable. Instead, focus on progress and improvement. You can always refine and perfect as you go along.\nLack of Time Many people cite a lack of time as a reason for not starting something new. While it\u0026rsquo;s true that life can be busy, even small, consistent efforts can add up over time. Set aside just a few minutes each day to work on your goal, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be amazed at the progress you can make.\nConclusion \u0026ldquo;Just Start\u0026rdquo; is a powerful mantra that can break the chains of procrastination, self-doubt, and fear that hold us back from pursuing our dreams and ambitions. By taking that crucial first step, you initiate a chain reaction of momentum, learning, and growth. Remember that progress is often more important than perfection, and even small steps can lead to significant achievements. So, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a personal project, a career change, or a new hobby, don\u0026rsquo;t wait for the perfect moment – \u0026ldquo;Just Start\u0026rdquo; today, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be on your way to realizing your aspirations.\n","date":"23 September 2023","permalink":"/just-start/","section":"Posts","summary":"Discover how that initial push can propel you forward, instill a sense of learning by doing, and ultimately help you surmount the obstacles that hinder progress.","title":"Just Start!"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2023","permalink":"/tags/procrastination/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Procrastination"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2023","permalink":"/tags/self-doubt/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Self-doubt"},{"content":"","date":"12 September 2023","permalink":"/tags/careers/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Careers"},{"content":"","date":"12 September 2023","permalink":"/tags/software-engineering/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Software Engineering"},{"content":"\u0026ldquo;Being a software engineer is similar to being a conductor of the digital symphony,\u0026rdquo; Alex enthusiastically proclaimed, swiveling his ergonomic chair to address a group of young people that had attended the tech summit.\nAlex\u0026rsquo;s sentiment mirrors a widely held view. In our hyper-digital age, the allure of software engineering, where one orchestrates the harmonious interplay of code, is undeniably compelling. It\u0026rsquo;s often hailed as a gateway to prosperity, a symbol of intellectual prowess, and an increasingly frequent response to the age-old question: \u0026ldquo;What do you aspire to become in adulthood?\u0026rdquo;\nBut is this career path truly the golden opportunity it\u0026rsquo;s often portrayed as, or could it possibly be overhyped? Beyond the glamour and the facade of limitless possibilities, does software engineering genuinely offer a path to wealth and self-fulfillment, or does it risk being just another job, susceptible to market fluctuations and the ever-evolving tech landscape? Let\u0026rsquo;s delve into it!\nGolden Opportunities — The Allure of Software Engineering In a world driven by data, bytes, and binary, software engineers emerge as modern-day alchemists, capable of transforming lines of code into digital gold. Consider this; who else but software engineers can conjure virtual realities, shape the digital realm, or teach machines to recognize a cat? It\u0026rsquo;s akin to wielding the power of Thor\u0026rsquo;s hammer, but instead of battling mythical beasts, you\u0026rsquo;re conducting the intricate movements of algorithms and untangling complex code.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that this profession is often celebrated. It offers an enticing compensation package, the thrill of perpetual learning, and the privilege of being at the forefront of technological progress. Furthermore, the sense of empowerment and creativity that stems from crafting software that impacts billions of lives is unparalleled.\nHowever, before you trade in your conductor\u0026rsquo;s baton for a keyboard and contemplate joining this digital ensemble, let\u0026rsquo;s take a behind-the-scenes glimpse. Keep in mind that even in the world of software engineering, challenges like managing demanding audiences, enduring relentless schedules, and adapting to less-than-ideal conditions can arise.\nThe Reality Check — Challenges in the Code World While software engineering certainly presents a captivating stage, it\u0026rsquo;s not all about the spotlight and applause. Challenges are ever-present in the realm of code.\nContinuous Learning Curve\nJust as you master one technology, another emerges. Remaining relevant necessitates constant learning, comparable to refining your musical repertoire to keep it fresh.\nPressing Deadlines\nLike conducting in front of a demanding audience, software engineers frequently contend with tight project schedules, leading to late nights and high-pressure scenarios.\nBugs and Glitches\nEven the most impressive symphonies have their off notes. In software, encountering bugs and glitches is inevitable, and debugging can be a time-consuming task.\nBurnout\nThe unceasing pace of the tech world can lead to burnout, similar to the exhaustion from an extended tour. Maintaining a work-life balance becomes essential to ward off career fatigue.\nJob Market Dynamics\nJust as musical trends evolve, so does the tech landscape. Job security isn\u0026rsquo;t guaranteed, and adaptability is vital to avoiding obsolescence.\nTeam Dynamics\nCollaboration is paramount, and not all team members harmonize perfectly. Navigating diverse personalities and overcoming teamwork challenges is part of the software engineer\u0026rsquo;s journey.\nIs Software Engineering Overrated? So, is software engineering the coveted opportunity everyone imagines it to be? It\u0026rsquo;s a nuanced question. Much like the world of conducting, it comes with both advantages and drawbacks. Success hinges on passion, dedication, and a genuine love for the art of coding.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re prepared for the thrill of orchestrating digital masterpieces and embracing the unpredictability of the tech world, software engineering can indeed be a fulfilling career. Nevertheless, it\u0026rsquo;s not for the faint-hearted, and the journey toward becoming a code maestro involves a mix of promising opportunities and gritty challenges.\nIn the end, whether you opt for a career as a conductor or in software engineering, the key is to follow your passion and discover fulfillment in the journey. Keep in mind that even renowned conductors had to start with humble beginnings and devote countless hours to their craft before taking center stage. So, dare to dream big, work diligently, and forge ahead with determination!\n","date":"12 September 2023","permalink":"/is-swe-overrated/","section":"Posts","summary":"Is software engineering the golden ticket to prosperity and fulfillment, or is it overrated in our hyper-digital age?","title":"Software Engineering — An Overrated Career or A Path to Prosperity?"},{"content":" Intro I just posted about how I created this site with Hugo here.\nAfter careful consideration, I began to feel a strong inclination to substitute Google Analytics with a less invasive alternative, GoatCounter.\nWhy GoatCounter?

In this blog post we will cover;\nWhat a static site generator is Intro to Hugo Using a free Hugo template to generate your blog Alright, let’s get right into it!\nWhat is a static site generator? A static site generator or SSG is defined as being\n\u0026ldquo;A script which takes in data, content and templates, processes them, and outputs a folder full of all the resultant pages and assets.\u0026rdquo;\nNow to break down this definition we can travel back in time before the era of SSG. In a traditional web server, when a user visits a page the server builds the content of that specific page using the underlying stack like PHP by fetching data from either the database or an API. The server then returns this result to the users browser and voila you have a website. These kinds of websites are referred to as dynamic websites. In contrast we have static websites that have stable content i.e the content viewed by all the users is the same (static).\nStatic site generators therefore take the data provided to them in this case a blog like this one written in either markdown, yaml or any specific format and parse it into a static website.\nSSG host flow Why use a site generator? There are a couple of reasons but just to mention a few\nStatic sites are fast. Since they don’t require a database and they pre-build all the pages, users can access content blazingly fast. Ease of deployment. Since these sites are static they essentially don’t need a complicated sever setup They are very cost effective. The server resources used are minimal since there is no database and the content is already prebuilt. Version Control. Since the entire site is a combination of files and folders, you can leverage GIT to keep track of changes and collaborate with others. Intro to Hugo There are several static site generators out there that you can choose from like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby and Next.js.\nIn this blog post we will mainly focus on Hugo, which is written in the Golang language.\nFor the purposes of this demo we will be using a linux machine. I will attach alternative guidelines for different platforms.\nTo get started, install Hugo as below\nsudo apt install hugo For installation on Windows or MacOS follow the guide here.\nAfter successfully installing Hugo you will have access to the hugo command in your terminal with which you can create your first site\nhugo new site mywebsite This command will create a directory, mywebsite, in the root directory.\nUsing a free Hugo template to generate your blog Using Hugo comes with the advantage of having access to a variety of free beautiful themes. You can use these themes to make your website. This lets you focus on sharing your content with the world and not dwell to much on designing.\nWe are going to use a theme called blowfish the very theme used on this site. It uses markdown files for content and yaml for configuration files. It is also very customizable to your preference.\nTo install this theme we will set it up a submodule in our hugo generated website.\ncd mywebsite git init git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish We are doing this mainly so that we can pull changes from the main blowfish repository in case they ever make important changes to the theme using.\ngit submodule update --remote --merge Configuring the Theme Blowfish does not constrain you on how to organize your content. An example of how to structure your content is as follows\n. ├── assets │ └── img │ └── author.jpg ├── config │ └── _default ├── content │ ├── _index.md │ ├── about.md │ └── posts │ ├── _index.md │ ├── first-post.md │ └── another-post │ ├── aardvark.jpg │ └── index.md └── themes └── blowfish There are numerous ways you can edit the theme to suit your needs read this documentation to find out how.\nRun this command locally to view your site.\nhugo server Conclusion In this article we covered what static site generators are, went over examples and specifically targeted Hugo.\nWe got to see how to use a free Hugo theme to implement a blog website and finally we served the website locally. It should be noted that from here you can easily deploy your website with Netlify for free in just a few simple steps.\nVoila! You have now set up a website with little to no coding.\n","date":"9 September 2023","permalink":"/static_sites/","section":"Posts","summary":"Discover the simplicity of building your own websites using \u003cstrong\u003eStatic Site Generators\u003c/strong\u003e.
